This is the map of Nielen [Designated Marketing Areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market) using D3.js. Hover over for data related to each area. 

The original hosted examples (included in the repo from which this was forked) are no longer functioning, so I've added hosted examples here:

     * Shapefile link is dead, an archived Geojson from Geocommons can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoiq/gc_data/master/datasets/998.geojson)

### Notes
* Some areas are shaped really strangely (such as a slice of Nevada being part of the Denver media market) but that is really how they are divided
